RouteMe is a Progressive Web App that path finds through themeparks, showing you the quickest route to take from A â†’ B.

This project began as a Microsoft Windows application, written in C#, and has evolved to a Progressive Web App built using [React](https://create-react-app.dev) and [Framework7](https://framework7.io).
