NoteMe is a Progressive Web App that stores your notes in Markdown.

The app stores your notes in a Firebase database. You can sign up to use the app with a Google account, which allows you to log in and edit your notes from any device.

The PWA is build using [React](https://create-react-app.dev) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com).
