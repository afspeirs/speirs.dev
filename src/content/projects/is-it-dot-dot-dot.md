Is it... is a Progressive Web App that tells you if it is a certain day or not

I have always enjoyed the apps that told you if it was Christmas Day, or &lt;insert any holiday here&gt;, and thought I could make my own that lets the User define what days they want to check.

The PWA is build using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
