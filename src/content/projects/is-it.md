Is it... is a Progressive Web App that tells you if it is a certain day or not

I have always enjoyed the apps that told you if it was Christmas Day, or &lt;insert any holiday here&gt;, and thought I could make my own that lets the User define what days they want to check.

This site is build using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
