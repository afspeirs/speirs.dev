NoteMe is a Progressive Web App that stores your notes in Markdown format.

The app stores your notes in a Firebase database. You can sign up to use the app with a Google account, which allows you to log in and edit your notes from any device.

The PWA is build using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), styled using [Tailwind](https://tailwind.com/), local storage using [RxDB](https://rxdb.info/) and replication to a database using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
