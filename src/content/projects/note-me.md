NoteMe is a Progressive Web App that stores your notes in Markdown format.

The app stores your notes locally to allow you to access you notes as quickly as possible. You can then optionally sign up for an account to allow your notes to be synchronised across devices.

The PWA is build using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), styled using [Tailwind](https://tailwind.com/), local storage using [RxDB](https://rxdb.info/) and replication to a database using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
