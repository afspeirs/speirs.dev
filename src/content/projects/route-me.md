RouteMe is a Progressive Web App that path finds through Alton Towers (A themepark based in the United Kingdom), showing you the quickest route to take from A â†’ B.

This project began as a Microsoft Windows application, written in C#, and has evolved to a PWA built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
