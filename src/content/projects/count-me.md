CountMe is a Progressive Web App that allows user to Create / Save / Update collections of items.

This idea was born out of travelling and counting a number of different items. I could not find a suitable app, and decided to make it myself.

The PWA is build using [React](https://create-react-app.dev), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) and [Framework7](https://framework7.io).
