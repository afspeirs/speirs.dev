This website serves as a place to house links to all the personal projects I have worked on.

Web technologies and frameworks that have been used to make this site:

- ~~Just HTML files ðŸ˜­~~
- ~~Gulp (and Browserify)~~
- ~~Eleventy (and Webpack)~~
- ~~Svelte (and Sapper)~~
- Svelte (with SvelteKit)

This site is currently made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) and [rollup](https://rollupjs.org).
