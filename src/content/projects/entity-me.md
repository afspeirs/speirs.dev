EntityMe is a Progressive Web App that displays all of the HTML entities, and provide an easy method of copying its contents

I was scraping <https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref> to get all of the data for the site to use. But then the page layout change and I started building my own list of entities.

One of the goals with this project is to have a npm package with access to all the entities for other developers to utilise.

This site is build using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
