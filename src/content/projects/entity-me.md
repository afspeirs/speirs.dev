EntityMe is a Progressive Web App that displays all of the HTML entities, and provide an easy method of copying its contents

I was scraping <https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref> to get all of the data for the site to use. But then the page layout change and I started building my own list of entities.

One of the goals with this project is to have a npm package with access to all the entities for other developers to utilise.

The PWA is build using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
