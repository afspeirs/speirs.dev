    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Andrew Speirs.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this website was to create something without utilising any frameworks. I have also used it to showcase all of the projects I have started.</p>
    <p>This also serves a motivation for me to continue making projects because now I finally have a place to showcase them.</p>
